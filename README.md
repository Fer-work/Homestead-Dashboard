# Project: Sentient Homestead - Intelligent Monitoring System

## üå± Vision

Sentient Homestead is a comprehensive monitoring system designed for the modern homesteader aiming for self-sufficiency and a deeper connection with their environment and food production systems. This project starts with a passion for sustainable living and leveraging technology to make homestead management more efficient, data-driven, and insightful.

The initial goal is to develop a robust system for monitoring key aspects of a small-scale urban aquaponics prototype, with plans to expand to larger, more diverse homesteading operations. While this begins as a personal tool, the journey and the core monitoring framework will be documented with the hope of inspiring and assisting fellow homesteaders who are interested in integrating technology into their practices.

_(This README focuses on the monitoring aspects of the project, which are intended for broader sharing and discussion. Specific advanced security deterrents developed for personal use are outside the scope of this public documentation.)_

## ‚ú® Core Monitoring Features (Stage 1 Focus)

- **Aquaponics System Monitoring:**
  - Real-time tracking of water pH, EC/TDS (Electrical Conductivity/Total Dissolved Solids).
  - Water temperature monitoring for fish tanks, sump, and grow beds.
  - Dissolved Oxygen (DO) levels for aquatic health.
  - Water level sensing for tanks and sump (with alerts for low/high conditions).
  - Monitoring of pump operational status.
- **Environmental Monitoring:**
  - Ambient temperature and humidity tracking for the plot/greenhouse environment.
- **Power System Monitoring (for Off-Grid Setup):**
  - Solar panel energy production.
  - Battery bank voltage, current, and state of charge.
  - Overall energy consumption by the homestead systems.
- **Centralized Web Dashboard:**
  - Intuitive visualization of all sensor data with charts and real-time readouts.
  - Customizable alert notifications for critical parameter deviations.
  - Historical data logging and trend analysis.
  - Accessible remotely to check on systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend:** React with Material UI (for a responsive and modern user interface).
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (using PERN stack principles, potentially with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data). _(Initial prototyping may use MongoDB/MERN stack before transitioning)._
- **IoT Devices & Microcontrollers:**
  - ESP32 modules for distributed sensor data collection and actuator control.
  - Raspberry Pi as an on-plot central hub/gateway for data aggregation, local processing, video (future), and communication.
  - Various sensors for environmental and system parameters.
- **Communication Protocols:** MQTT for robust IoT messaging, HTTPS for API communication, (potentially WebSockets for real-time dashboard updates).
- **Cloud Services (Potential for Database Hosting/Notifications):** Exploring options like Neon.tech for PostgreSQL, and cloud-based notification services.

## High-Level Overview

The system is designed with a layered approach:

1.  **Sensing Layer:** Various sensors (pH, temperature, water level, motion, power, etc.) are deployed across the aquaponics system, power system, and general plot environment.
2.  **Microcontroller Layer:** ESP32 modules collect data from these sensors, perform initial processing if needed, and can control local actuators (e.g., pumps based on aquaponics logic).
3.  **Plot Hub/Gateway Layer:** A Raspberry Pi located on the plot acts as a central hub. It gathers data from all ESP32 nodes (likely via a local MQTT broker), manages local data logging for resilience, processes local video (future), and serves as the secure gateway to the external network (neighbor's Wi-Fi, then to the cloud/apartment server).
4.  **Backend Server Layer:** A Node.js/Express.js application (running in the cloud or self-hosted in the apartment) receives data from the Plot Hub. It handles data validation, storage in the PostgreSQL database, user authentication, API logic for the dashboard, and alert processing.
5.  **Frontend Dashboard Layer:** A React-based web application provides the user interface for monitoring all systems, viewing historical data, configuring settings, and receiving alerts.

## üöÄ Project Status

- **Current Phase:** Remote Research & Development (R&D) - June/July [Current Year]
  - Focus on prototyping core software components (dashboard, backend APIs).
  - Testing sensor integration with ESP32s and Raspberry Pi.
  - Designing and testing solar power solutions for off-grid plot electronics.
- **Next Phase:** On-site deployment and development of Stage 1 Urban Prototype (8m x 12m plot).

## Future Goals - Publicly Shareable Aspects

- Complete and refine the Stage 1 urban aquaponics monitoring prototype.
- Develop a robust, user-friendly dashboard with comprehensive data visualization and alert management.
- Expand monitoring to include soil moisture, light levels, and other environmental factors relevant to broader gardening/homesteading.
- Integrate basic automation logic for aquaponics system management (e.g., automated fish feeding, water top-offs) based on sensor readings.
- **Share the Journey:** Create a YouTube video series documenting the build process, challenges, and successes of the Stage 1 prototype and beyond (focusing on the monitoring systems and DIY aquaponics).
- Develop simplified guides or open-source components (e.g., ESP32 sensor modules for specific homesteading tasks) if there's community interest.
- Explore integrating machine learning for predictive analytics (e.g., predicting crop issues, optimizing energy use).

## ü§ù Contributing & Contact

Currently, this is a personal project under development. However, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and learning from the community. Future updates on progress and potential ways to collaborate or share designs will be posted if the project evolves in that direction.

Stay tuned for updates as the Sentient Homestead takes root!
